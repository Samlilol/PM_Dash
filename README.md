# PMetrics-2.0
## Background
Everything starts from my own experience as a junior product manager who knew nothing about product management but tried to "lead" a new product from 0 to 1 in a medium-sized company. The result was disastrous and project was suspended due to the shift of company priority. I wish I could know more before taking lead and hence the project might keep going.

I can only control what I can control, so I decide to build a open source community to gather people who love products, no matter you are a junior, builder, pm, engineer, designer. As long as you are in love with product, please feel free to join and help to enlarge the product community. 

## Goal
This repo aims to 
1. Consolidate study materials for young professionals who want to understand more about Product Management
2. Share useful prompts that might help a junior pm to adapt faster in a new role
3. Be treated as resources to grow data driven pm community
