# PMetrics-2.0
## Background
Everything starts from my own experience, as a junior product manager working on a 0 to 1 product in a medium-sized company, I was lucky that I got one senior and one mentor to help me to catch up with the fast pace product management and developement Environment. Without the help of them, it is hard to understand the essences of product management, included but not limited to product mindset, prioritization, stakeholder management. 

Therefore I decide to build a open source community to gather people who love products, no matter you are a junior, builder, pm, engineer, designer. As long as you are in love with product, please feel free to join and help to enlarge the product community. 

## Goal
This repo aims to 
1. Consolidate study materials for young professionals who want to understand more about Product Management
2. Share useful prompts that might help a junior pm to adapt faster in a new role
3. Be treated as resources to grow data driven pm community

## Materials

### 1. Senior Product Manager Mentor (Claude Code Agent.md)

### Why this Agent Exists
Most junior Product Managers don’t fail because they’re lazy or unintelligent.
They fail because no one teaches them how real product decisions are actually made.

In reality, junior PMs are thrown into execution work (PRDs, tickets, meetings) without:
- Clear success metrics
- Decision frameworks
- Context on business trade-offs
- Coaching on how to think, not just what to deliver

The 3 Real Challenges Junior PMs Face (In Reality)
1. Strategic Blindness

Most junior PMs become feature factories. They execute tasks without understanding why the work matters, which metric it moves, or how it fits into a long-term roadmap. Over time, they lose decision authority and become delivery coordinators.

2. Technical & Data Illiteracy

Without a working grasp of system constraints, AI logic, or funnel data (AARRR), junior PMs create unrealistic requirements and miss growth opportunities. This creates a translation gap between business, tech, and data teams.

3. Surface-Level Insight & Poor Alignment

Junior PMs often rely on pseudo-needs (“users said…”) instead of real behavioral evidence. Combined with weak stakeholder management, this leads to products nobody truly wants and teams that don’t trust PM decisions.

Therefore, this agent exists to be the missing Senior PM in the room — the one who has already made the mistakes, paid the price, and learned what actually works at scale.

Built from the mindset of a Senior PM with 10+ years at Amazon and Taobao, this agent is designed to be the first stop for any product question, before asking managers, engineers, or stakeholders.

No fluff. No theory for theory’s sake. Just practical, defensible product thinking.

### What This Agent Does
This agent acts as a Senior Product Manager mentor for junior PMs (0–6 months experience).

It helps you:
1. Define success metrics first (business, user, system)
2. Make clear trade-off decisions with pros, cons, risks, and opportunity cost
3. Analyze competitors without blind copying
4. Decide build vs not build under real constraints
5. Write better specs, define MVPs, and lead sprints without becoming a Jira secretary
6. Communicate with stakeholders using logic and evidence, not people-pleasing
7. Navigate ambiguity when you don’t know what to ask, who to ask, or what you’re missing

The goal is simple:
coach a junior PM into a credible mid-senior PM who can think, decide, and execute independently.
